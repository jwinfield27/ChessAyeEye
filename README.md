I'm not married to any of the work I've done, if you want to change the names of any classes/ fucntions/ variables so that they're more clear or make more sense to you thats fine. Also tried to comment and document my thoughts for what I intended for each function and class to be, if you'd like me to comment more (or less) let me know.

-Move Highlighting
    - To get accurate move highlighting pick up and drop the piece then pick it up again, this should highlight the correct squares.

-Controller
    - squareID refers to the integer ID of the square that the piece we want is sitting on.
    - leavingSquare and attackingSquare both refer to the square which has the piece that is doing the action.
    - destination and capturedSquare both refer to the square which is having the action done to them (being captured, meing moved onto)
